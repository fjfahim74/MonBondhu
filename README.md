# MonBondhu — Your Community Health Companion

## Project Overview
MonBondhu is a web application designed to improve access to mental and general health support for rural Bangladeshi communities. The app focuses on culturally-sensitive interventions, offline accessibility, and voice-first interaction to serve low-literacy users effectively. The project aligns with SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being and emphasizes dignity, privacy, and usability.

## Project Objective
- Create a simple, inclusive, and culturally-aware health platform for rural Bangladesh.
- Provide tools for mental health check-ins, maternal and child health tracking, preventive care awareness, and more.
- Ensure offline functionality and voice-based accessibility for low-literacy users.
- Deliver the application as a progressive web app (PWA) or Figma design for demonstration purposes.

## Target Users
- Rural Bangladeshi communities with low literacy levels.
- Elderly users and individuals with limited digital experience.
- Users who rely on local community health workers rather than centralized clinics.

## Language and Accessibility Strategy
- Primary Language: Bangla (Unicode) for all text, prompts, and menus.
- Voice Assistance: All key actions and instructions are supported via Bangla speech recognition and text-to-speech.
- Rationale: Rural users are more comfortable with Bangla, and voice-first interactions help those with low literacy.

### UX Considerations
- Minimal typing; mostly buttons, icons, and voice interactions.
- Visual aids accompany text for comprehension.
- Respectful, non-stigmatizing language throughout.

## Pages Overview
The application will have the following main pages/screens, each designed to meet specific user needs:

### Landing Page
- Content: Hero image of rural Bangladesh, inspirational quote, app tagline.
- Purpose: Introduce MonBondhu and establish trust with users.
- Language: Bangla.
